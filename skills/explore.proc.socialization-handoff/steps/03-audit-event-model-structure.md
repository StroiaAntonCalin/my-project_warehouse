# Step 3: Audit Event Model and Document Structure

Examine events for noise and document for redundancy.

```
Event Model Audit

| # | Event | External Value? | Proposed Action | Evidence |
|---|-------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | [Event] | Yes — consumed by [Domain] | Keep | [VALIDATED] |
| 2 | [Event] | No — status noise | Consolidate with [Event] | [VALIDATED] |

Document Structure Audit

| # | Section | Assessment | Proposed Action |
|---|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | [Section] | Contains decision content | Keep as-is |
| 2 | [Section] | Redundant with [other section] | Shorten — merge key points |

Events: keep [N], consolidate [N]
Sections: keep [N], shorten [N]

How would you like to proceed?
- Review full simplification summary — show me all proposals together
- Override — keep specific items (tell me which)
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to validate event and structure proposals.
