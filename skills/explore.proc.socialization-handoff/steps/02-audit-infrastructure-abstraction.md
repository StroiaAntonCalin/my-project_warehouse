# Step 2: Audit Infrastructure and Abstraction Level

Examine technology choices and abstraction level for unjustified complexity.

```
Infrastructure Audit

| # | Technology/Choice | Justified by THIS Workload? | Inherited from Adjacent? | Proposed Action | Evidence |
|---|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | [Tech] | Yes — [Justification] | No | Keep | [VALIDATED] |
| 2 | [Tech] | No | Yes — [Adjacent HLD] | Flag for justification | [ASSUMPTION] |

Abstraction Level Audit

| # | Item | Belongs in HLD? | Proposed Action | Evidence |
|---|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | [Detail] | Yes — architectural decision | Keep | [VALIDATED] |
| 2 | [Detail] | No — implementation detail | Defer to LLD | [VALIDATED] |

Infrastructure items: [N] (keep: [N], flag: [N])
Abstraction items: [N] (keep: [N], defer: [N])

How would you like to proceed?
- Review next category — proceed to event model audit
- Override — keep a specific item (tell me which and why)
- Remove additional — I see more items that should be simplified
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to validate infrastructure and abstraction proposals.
