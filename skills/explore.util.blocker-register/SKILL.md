# Blocker Register

Track missing upstream contracts, unresolved dependencies, and implementation blockers with severity classification throughout an HLD engagement.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- Track missing upstream contracts that block implementation
- Log unresolved dependencies on other teams or artifacts
- Flag implementation gaps discovered during design
- Classify blockers by severity (BLOCKER / SIGNIFICANT / MINOR)
- Assign owning teams and resolution paths to each blocker
- Maintain a living record of what must be resolved before implementation

**Processes that use this skill**:
- Architecture Copilot (Steps 1–4: all steps — loaded eagerly at Step 1, persists through engagement)

**Key principle**: Blockers are logged proactively the instant they are discovered. Do not wait to be asked. Every PROVISIONAL dependency is a potential blocker.

## Inputs to Request

Before initializing a blocker register, ensure you have:

1. **HLD name** — the name of the HLD engagement for the register header
2. **Engagement start date** — for the first entry timestamp
3. **Slug** — project identifier for file naming (e.g., `payments-reconciliation`)

**STOP**: If the HLD name or slug is not confirmed, request it from the architect before proceeding.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Initialize the Blocker Register

Create the blocker register file at the start of the engagement.

```
Blocker Register Initialized

File: explore/hlds/[slug]-blocker-register.md
HLD: [HLD Name]
Engagement start: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Open blockers: 0

The blocker register is now active. Blockers will be added proactively as they are discovered throughout the engagement.

How would you like to proceed?
- Confirm — blocker register is ready
- Adjust — change the HLD name or slug
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to confirm the blocker register is initialized correctly.

### Step 2: Log a Blocker

When any of the following are identified, add an entry immediately — do not wait for a review phase:

- Missing upstream contract (API, event, or data source assumed but not confirmed)
- Unresolved dependency (design element depending on another team's decision)
- Implementation gap (cannot safely implement without resolution)
- Ambiguous requirement (PRD or stakeholder requirement with multiple valid interpretations)

```
Blocker Logged: BLK-[NNN]

Title: [Short descriptive title]
Discovered: [YYYY-MM-DD] (Step [N])
Category: Missing Contract / Unresolved Dependency / Implementation Gap / Ambiguous Requirement

Description: [What is missing or unresolved]
Impact: [What cannot proceed without this]
Owning team: [Who must resolve this]
Resolution path: [Recommended approach]
Related decisions: DEC-[NNN] (if applicable)

Severity: [BLOCKER / SIGNIFICANT / MINOR]
Severity rationale: [Why this classification]

Running total: [N] open blockers ([N] BLOCKER, [N] SIGNIFICANT, [N] MINOR)

How would you like to proceed?
- Correct severity — this should be classified differently
- Add context — I have additional information about this blocker
- Acknowledge — blocker logged, continue with current work
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to acknowledge or reclassify the blocker.

### Step 3: Classify Severity

Apply consistent severity classification using these definitions:

```
Severity Classification Guide

| Severity | Definition | Action Required | Example |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| BLOCKER | Cannot implement safely without resolving | Must resolve before implementation begins | Missing upstream API contract with no fallback |
| SIGNIFICANT | Should resolve before wider review / socialization | Resolve before Step 4 | Ambiguous requirement with two valid interpretations |
| MINOR | Can defer to LLD or later iteration | Track but do not block progress | Naming convention mismatch with adjacent HLD |

Current blocker distribution:
| Severity | Open | Resolved |
|----------|------|----------|
| BLOCKER | [N] | [N] |
| SIGNIFICANT | [N] | [N] |
| MINOR | [N] | [N] |

Any severity reclassifications needed?
- Reclassify — tell me which blocker and new severity
- All correct — classifications are accurate
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to validate severity classifications (typically at the end of Step 3: Review & Hardening).

### Step 4: Resolve a Blocker

When a blocker is resolved, update the entry with resolution details.

```
Blocker Resolved: BLK-[NNN]

Original blocker: [Title]
Original severity: [BLOCKER / SIGNIFICANT / MINOR]
Discovered: [Date] (Step [N])

Resolution: [What was done to resolve this]
Resolved by: [Who — architect, stakeholder, owning team]
Resolution date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Related decision: DEC-[NNN] (if a new decision was made)

BLK-[NNN] status updated to: Resolved

Remaining open blockers: [N] ([N] BLOCKER, [N] SIGNIFICANT, [N] MINOR)

How would you like to proceed?
- Confirm resolution — blocker is fully resolved
- Partial resolution — blocker is reduced but not eliminated (reclassify severity)
- Reopen — resolution is insufficient, keep blocker open
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to confirm the resolution is adequate.

### Step 5: Mid-Engagement Summary

At the end of each step, produce a blocker register summary for the architect.

```
Blocker Register Summary — End of Step [N]

| # | Title | Category | Severity | Status | Owning Team |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| BLK-001 | [Title] | [Category] | BLOCKER | Open / Resolved | [Team] |
| BLK-002 | [Title] | [Category] | SIGNIFICANT | Open / Resolved | [Team] |

Open: [N] ([N] BLOCKER, [N] SIGNIFICANT, [N] MINOR)
Resolved: [N]

⚠️ Implementation readiness: [Ready / Blocked — N BLOCKER items remain]

How would you like to proceed?
- All accurate — proceed to next step
- Reclassify — tell me which blocker and new severity
- Add blocker — I know of a blocker that wasn't logged
- Resolve blocker — tell me which blocker and how it was resolved
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to validate the blocker register summary before proceeding to the next step.

### Step 6: Finalize Blocker Register

At engagement completion, run the validation checklist and produce the final version.

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Every discovered blocker has an entry (none silently dropped)
- [ ] Every entry has: title, category, severity, description, impact, owning team, resolution path
- [ ] Severity classifications validated by architect (especially during Step 3)
- [ ] Every resolved blocker has: resolution description, date, who resolved it
- [ ] Related decision log entries linked where applicable
- [ ] No BLOCKER-severity items remain open (or explicitly deferred by architect with rationale)
- [ ] Summary table matches detail section (no missing or extra entries)
- [ ] File written to correct path with correct slug

```
Blocker Register Complete

File: explore/hlds/[slug]-blocker-register.md
Total blockers: [N]
Open: [N] ([N] BLOCKER, [N] SIGNIFICANT, [N] MINOR)
Resolved: [N]
Implementation readiness: [Ready / Blocked]
Validation: [N] of 8 checks passed ✓

Ready for handoff as companion document to final HLD.
```

**STOP**: Wait for architect to confirm the blocker register is finalized.

## Output Format

```
explore/hlds/[slug]-blocker-register.md
```

**Template**: `templates/blocker-register.md`

1. **Header** — HLD name, engagement start date, last updated date, open/resolved counts
2. **Summary Table** — severity distribution (open vs resolved per category)
3. **Open Blockers** — each entry (BLK-NNN) with severity, category, description, impact, owning team, resolution path, related decisions
4. **Resolved Blockers** — each entry with original severity, resolution, resolved by, date

## Integration with Workflows

Architecture Copilot loads this skill eagerly before Step 1 begins. It persists across all 4 steps of the engagement and is one of the 4 final deliverables in the handoff package. Blockers flow in from every other skill as PROVISIONAL dependencies and implementation gaps are discovered.

**Integrates with**:
- **Boundary Mapping** — feeds PROVISIONAL upstream dependencies as initial blocker candidates
- **Design Sketch** — feeds assumed event schemas and API contracts as potential blockers
- **HLD Drafting** — feeds missing contracts discovered during full draft generation
- **Feedback Integration** — feeds hardening findings classified as BLOCKER or SIGNIFICANT
- **Decision Log** — references decision entries when blockers are related to architectural decisions

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- Log blockers immediately when discovered — do not wait for a review phase
- Assign an owning team to every blocker — blockers without owners don't get resolved
- Provide a concrete resolution path — not just "needs resolution"
- Link to related decision log entries when the blocker stems from a design choice
- Produce a summary at the end of each step for architect validation
- Track resolved blockers with full details — don't just delete them

**Don't**:
- Wait to be asked before logging a blocker — proactive logging is mandatory
- Classify everything as BLOCKER — use the severity guide to differentiate
- Leave resolved blockers without resolution details — the audit trail matters
- Drop blockers silently — every discovered blocker must have an entry
- Skip the mid-engagement summary — it catches missing or misclassified blockers
- Assume a blocker is resolved without confirmation — always verify with architect

If you propose changes, keep them minimal and clearly scoped.

## Gotchas

- ⚡ **Severity inflation**: The agent tends to classify everything as BLOCKER to appear cautious. Overuse of BLOCKER severity causes decision fatigue for the architect. Use the severity guide strictly — a missing upstream contract that has a known workaround is not a BLOCKER.
- ⚡ **Silent resolution**: The agent sometimes stops mentioning a blocker after context shifts, treating it as implicitly resolved. Every blocker must be explicitly resolved with resolution details and architect confirmation — silence is not resolution.
- ⚡ **Duplicate entries**: When the same underlying issue surfaces in multiple steps, the agent may log it as separate blockers. Always check existing entries before logging — duplicate blockers dilute the register's usefulness.
