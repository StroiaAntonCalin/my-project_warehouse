| # | Feedback Item | Disposition | Rationale | Evidence |
|---|--------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | [Change/critique] | Accept | [Why accepted] | [VALIDATED] |
| 2 | [Change/critique] | Accept w/ Modification | [Valid concern, different implementation] | [VALIDATED] |
| 3 | [Change/critique] | Reject | [Why rejected — cite rule] | [VALIDATED] |

### Rejected Items — Detailed Rationale

| # | Feedback Item | Rejection Reason | Architectural Rule Violated |
|---|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| [N] | [Item] | [Why rejected] | [Which rule or decision it conflicts with] |

## 3. Regression Check

- [✓/✗] No previously resolved architectural decisions silently reopened
- [✓/✗] Boundary ownership stable (no drift from boundary map)
- [✓/✗] Event/state semantics consistent (no meaning changes)
- [✓/✗] Component descriptions remain non-overlapping

**Regressions detected**: [N]
[If any: describe each regression with the decision it affects]
