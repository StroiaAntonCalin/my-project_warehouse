Produces a persistent domain profile that informs all future engagements.

# Domain Onboarding

## Step Execution Rule
**ONE STEP AT A TIME**: Read step → Execute step → Complete step → Next step
❌ Reading ahead ❌ Multiple steps ❌ Skipping step files

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- Begin working in a domain the agent has no persistent knowledge for
- Populate the persistent knowledge store with domain-specific vocabulary, constraints, regulations, patterns, and quality priorities
- Establish authority pattern guidance for truth hierarchy construction in future engagements
- The human explicitly says "new domain" or the agent detects no domain profile exists

**Processes that use this skill**:
- Architecture Copilot (Step 0: Domain Onboarding — one-time per domain, before Step 1)

**Key principle**: This is a lightweight 30-minute interview, not a week-long discovery. The domain profile is a living document enriched by the improvement loop after each engagement.

## Inputs to Request

Before running domain onboarding, ensure you have:

1. **Domain name** — what domain is this? (e.g., "healthcare claims processing," "logistics fleet management")
2. **Human with domain expertise** — someone who can answer questions about the domain's vocabulary, constraints, regulations, and patterns
3. **Any existing domain documentation** — glossaries, architecture diagrams, regulatory guides, prior HLDs (optional but helpful)

**STOP**: If the agent already has a domain profile for this domain in persistent knowledge, confirm with the human whether to skip onboarding or refresh the profile.

## Process Steps

| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | [01-vocabulary-and-scope.md](./steps/01-vocabulary-and-scope.md) | Structured interview to capture domain vocabulary and scope |
| 2 | [02-constraints-and-regulations.md](./steps/02-constraints-and-regulations.md) | Capture regulatory, technical, and organizational constraints |
| 3 | [03-patterns-and-authority.md](./steps/03-patterns-and-authority.md) | Capture architectural patterns, authority structures, and quality priorities |
| 4 | [04-assemble-validate.md](./steps/04-assemble-validate.md) | Compile responses into domain profile and run validation checklist |

## Output Format

```
persistent-knowledge/[domain]-profile.md
```

**Templates**: `templates/domain-profile.md`, `templates/pattern-library.md`

1. **Domain Overview** — name, description, industry vertical
2. **Domain Vocabulary** — terms with definitions, synonyms, usage notes
3. **Key Architectural Concerns** — what matters and why
4. **Known Constraints** — technical, organizational, regulatory, timeline, budget
5. **Regulatory Landscape** — applicable regulations with requirements and architectural impact
6. **Common Architectural Patterns** — patterns with when-to-use and when-not-to-use
7. **Authority Patterns** — truth hierarchy guidance for this domain
8. **Quality Priorities** — default quality attribute rankings
9. **Domain-Specific Hardening Items** — additional checks beyond universal categories

## Integration with Workflows

Architecture Copilot (Step 0: Domain Onboarding) loads this skill once per new domain. It runs before Step 1 and populates the persistent knowledge store. The domain profile feeds into all future engagements: engagement scoping uses quality priorities, boundary mapping uses authority patterns, design sketch uses architectural patterns, and hardening uses domain-specific checks.

**Consumes**:
- **Knowledge Extraction** — Improvement loop enriches the domain profile with DOMAIN-scoped learnings

**Produces** (consumed by):
- **Boundary Mapping** (`explore.proc.boundary-mapping`) — Authority patterns feed truth hierarchy construction
- **Design Sketch** (`explore.proc.design-sketch`) — Architectural patterns inform decision point analysis
- **Feedback Integration** (`explore.proc.feedback-integration`) — Domain-specific hardening items extend the checklist

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- Keep the interview lightweight — 30 minutes, not a week-long discovery
- Capture definitions, not just term names — "what does X mean in YOUR context?"
- Ask about ambiguous terms explicitly — same word, different meaning across sub-domains
- Document authority patterns as suggestions, not mandates — each engagement confirms its own hierarchy
- Include "when NOT to use" for every pattern — negative guidance is as valuable as positive

**Don't**:
- Pretend to know a domain you haven't been onboarded to — if no profile exists, say so
- Run this for every engagement — once per domain, then skip (unless human requests a refresh)
- Make the profile exhaustive — it's a living document that gets enriched over time
- Impose authority patterns from one domain onto another — each domain has its own truth structures
- Skip the regulatory landscape section — even "none applicable" is important to document

If you propose changes, keep them minimal and clearly scoped.

## Gotchas

- ⚡ **Cross-domain authority bleeding**: Each domain has its own truth hierarchy and authority patterns. The agent tends to carry authority assumptions from a previously onboarded domain into a new one. Always start fresh — never assume "this domain works like the last one."
- ⚡ **Regulatory blind spot**: Even when stakeholders say "no regulations apply," there are almost always data handling, privacy, or accessibility requirements. Always probe with specific regulatory categories rather than accepting a blanket "none applicable."
- ⚡ **Profile completeness vs. accuracy**: The agent may pad the domain profile with inferred information to appear thorough. A sparse but accurate profile is far more valuable than a comprehensive but speculative one. Tag every entry with its evidence source.
